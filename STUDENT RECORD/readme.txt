Student Record Management System (C)

📌 Project Overview
The Student Record Management System is a console-based application developed in C programming language. This project is designed to manage student information efficiently while demonstrating fundamental and advanced concepts of C such as structures, dynamic memory allocation (DMA), linked lists, and file handling.

The application stores student records in a linked list during runtime and saves the data permanently using file handling, ensuring that records are not lost after program termination.

🎯 Objectives
• To understand and implement structures for organizing student data
• To use dynamic memory allocation for efficient memory usage
• To implement linked lists (add at end) for data management
• To perform file operations for permanent data storage
• To build a menu-driven console application in C

⚙️ Features
• Add student records dynamically
• Store student data using structures
• Manage records using a linked list (add at end)
• Save and retrieve data from files
• Menu-driven interface for easy interaction
• Efficient memory and data handling

🛠️ Technologies & Concepts Used
• C Programming Language
• Structures
• Dynamic Memory Allocation (malloc, free)
• Linked List (Add at End)
• File Handling (fopen, fread, fwrite, fclose)
• Conditional statements and loops

🧠 How It Works
1.The program displays a menu to the user.
2.Student details are entered and stored using structures.
3.Memory is allocated dynamically for each student record.
4.Records are linked together using a linked list.
5.Data is written to and read from a file for permanent storage.
6.The program continues until the user chooses to exit.

▶️ How to Compile and Run
1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/mohammedfareeth/C-PROJECT.git

2.Navigate to the project directory:
cd C-PROJECT

3.Compile the program:
gcc *.c -o student_record

4.Run the program:
./student_record

📂 Use Case
This project is ideal for:
• C programming beginners
• Students learning data structures
• Academic mini-projects
• Understanding memory management and file handling in C

✨ Conclusion
This project provides hands-on experience with essential C programming concepts and demonstrates how data structures and file handling can be combined to create a practical application. It serves as a strong foundation for further development in systems programming and data management.
